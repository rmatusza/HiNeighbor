# INTRO

Hi Neighbor is a full stack web application that seeks to replicate a simplified version of an ecommerce site and is a sort of combination of craigslist and ebay. The application is only intended to showcase my ability to create a dynamic multi-page web application as well as demonstrate an understanding of the technologies used in its creation. Therefore, users can 'purchase' items on the site, but there is no payment system built in to the application
